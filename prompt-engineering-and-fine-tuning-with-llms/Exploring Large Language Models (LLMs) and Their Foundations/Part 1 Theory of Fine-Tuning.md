**Part 1: Theory of Fine-Tuning**

**Concept Check (Multiple Choice Questions)**

1. **What is the main benefit of fine-tuning an LLM?**
   - A) It improves the modelâ€™s speed.
   - B) It customizes the model for specific tasks or domains. **(Correct Answer)**
   - C) It eliminates the need for high-quality datasets.
   - D) It prevents overfitting entirely.

2. **Which of the following describes "catastrophic forgetting"?**
   - A) When the model forgets its pre-training data during inference.
   - B) When the model loses its generalization ability after excessive fine-tuning on a specific task. **(Correct Answer)**
   - C) When the model produces irrelevant outputs due to overfitting.
   - D) When the model fails to save fine-tuned weights.

**Application Task**

**Transfer Learning Explanation (150-200 words)**
Transfer learning is akin to learning a new language based on existing knowledge of another language. For example, a Spanish speaker may find it easier to learn Italian than someone without prior experience with Romance languages. This is because certain grammatical structures, vocabulary, and pronunciation patterns are similar.

In machine learning, transfer learning enables a pre-trained model to leverage previously acquired knowledge for a related task. For instance, an LLM trained on vast amounts of general text can be fine-tuned for legal document summarization. Instead of training a model from scratch, which is computationally expensive and data-intensive, fine-tuning adapts an existing model to a specialized domain efficiently.

**Example Dataset Structure for Fine-Tuning (Sentiment Analysis Task)**
| ID  | Text                                          | Label  |
|----|----------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1  | The movie was fantastic, I loved it!       | Positive |
| 2  | The food was terrible, I wouldn't recommend.| Negative |
| 3  | An average experience, nothing special.     | Neutral  |
